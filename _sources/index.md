# TV Show or Movie Classification
Hello everyone!!
This Jupyter Book basically shows all the works related to my project of "Movie Classification" which aims to predict and classify the Age category of people who see and rate movies. This book holds all the experiments, implementation, visualization and required code as well available in different platforms. I hope it acts as a very interactive user friendly tool for users.
